#Feb 12 Reflection

*What I Built
Worked on Placement Readiness Tracker (React + Vite)
Implemented:
  - Weekly goal input
  - Add solved problems
  - Percentage calculation
  - Dynamic progress bar
  - Color-based status (Red / Orange / Green)
  - Reset Weekly Goal Button
  - LocalStorage persistece
  - Automatic weekly reset logic 

*What I did Well
- Took time to deeply understand recursion problems
- Performed dry run instead of rushing

*What needs improvement
- Reduce Distractions
- Improve focus during deep work blocks
- Increase DSA problem volume after concept clarity

*Reflection
- Today reinforced that understanding concepts deeply is more important than rushing completion.Building the tracker strengthened my grasp of state management and persistence logic.
