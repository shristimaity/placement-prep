BASE CASE - The base case is the condition where the problem becomes simple enough to solve directly and recursion stops.

RECURSIVE CASE - The function calling itself. Problem is reduced into one or more smaller subproblems.

THE NORMAL FIBBONACCI IS SLOW:
 - Recursive Fibonacci is slow because it recomputes the same subproblems multiple times, leading to exponential time complexity O(2^n).

BACKTRACKING - Backtracking is a recursion technique where we explore possible solutions, and if a path does not lead to a valid solution, we undo the last choice and try a different path.
